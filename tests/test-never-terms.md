# Test markdown file with never-replace terms

This file contains Azure AI Services references.

Some should be protected like Azure AI Services (legacy) and https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/.

But regular Azure AI Services should be replaced.

Code references like Microsoft.CognitiveServices and azure-ai-services-python should remain unchanged.

More Azure AI Services mentions for testing.

And Azure AI Foundry should follow the normal replacement rules.
